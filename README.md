# Gurthang CLI Site

Static, terminal-themed microsite that imagines Gurthang (Nic's assistant) as a black-screen shell. Built for creative self-expression and hosted on GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a browser—no build step required.

## Deploying

GitHub Pages → **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment** → **Source: Deploy from a branch** → **Branch: `main` / root**.

Once Pages is enabled, the site will be available at `https://nicbotes.github.io/scratch/`.
